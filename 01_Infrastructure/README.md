# Infrastructure workshops

This folder contains workshops related to deploying Infrastructure on Azure.  

## Notes:
1. There may be cross-posts/links to App Dev tutorials as Infrastructure in some cases could relate to deploying Azure App Services or other Serverless models.  This is most often to occur when outlining **DevOps** practices, as it would be both a Dev and ITPro (Ops) domain.
